keymap ref

Kodi can process multiple keymap files and does so like this:

    All *.xml files from the default install settings and userdata/keymaps/ folders are applied as keymaps.
    All *.xml files are processed in alphabetical order.
    Keymaps defined in an .xml file add to or override mappings in previous .xml file.
    Keymaps defined in the userdata folder add to or override mappings in the global keymap.


global keymap = keyboard.xml (found in userdata folder)



The format is:::::

      <window> 
        <device> 
          <gesture>action</gesture>
        </device> 
      </window>



The <global> section is the 'default'
setting and will be overridden by all
other sections.
