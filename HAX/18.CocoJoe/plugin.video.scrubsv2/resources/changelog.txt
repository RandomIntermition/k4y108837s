- 5.0.10 small text adjustment in the settings. tossed the debug tools into cleantools_widget when the dev settings enabled. Fixed a couple more missed label errors for kodi 18. Added the Unaired Color code back in for movies that havent aired yet. Added a new "Watch [Show] Online" section in More Stuff. (still needs testing and work.)
